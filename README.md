This is a documentation of my processing sketches i have worked on in my first semester.

## "Paint for poor people"

One of my first tasks in the course was to develop some kind of machine with an interface.
I decided recreate the well known programm "Paint". I have used the ControllP5 Library for the interface elements on top of the programm.
It is very easy with CP5 to add buttons, sliders and other interface elements. 
In "Paint for poor people", you can choose between three different colors, an eraser-tool, and you can controll the width of the brush stroke.
